Brushing your teeth harder doesn’t mean they will be any cleaner, it was the way you brush which is more important than pressure you use!\n\nRemember dental plaque is a very soft substance and doesn’t need much effort to remove it, just a little pressure in the right place.\n\nAvoid brushing your teeth for at least 30 minutes after you eat something. Consuming acidic or sugary food can temporarily weaken surface tooth enamel and by brushing too soon after it can brush this surface enamel away. – (double check this)\n\nDon’t brush back and forth like they do in the movies, you will usually end up missing area and overbrushing your teeth causing you tooth wear and sensitivity.\n\nDon’t rush your brushing, focus and pay attention! This will help you in the long run and save you many dental visits.\n\nRemember to replace your toothbrush or oscillating head when the bristles start to bend and soften, this usually take around 3 months. If your toothbrush starts to look like this only after a few weeks you’re likely brushing too hard!"

The fact of the matter is that it is far more important how good your technique is rather than what brush you use, if you miss cleaning certain areas it doesn’t matter what type of brush you use. Those area are not going to be cleans.\n\nI’ve seen patients have brilliant oral hygiene using either type, however personally I prefer to use an electric toothbrush. I found it requires less technique than the manual brushes and it has helped improve motivations in my patient to kept teeth clean. Again the choice is yours, just make sure you use the right technique!"

Hence it is very important to see your dentist. "

                "data": "Dental plaque is a sticky, colourless “biofilm”, simply put it is a gathering of different type of bacteria that grows on the surface of teeth. It is the major cause of the two main dental diseases “Gum Disease” and “Dental Caries”. Its formation is a natural normal process which cannot be prevented, even within one hour of brushing your teeth, millions of this bacteria grow back. So you may be wondering why do we even bother brushing our teeth?\n\nWell when dental plaque first forms it is very soft and easy to remove with gentle brush strokes. When it is left to build up by accidently forgetting to brush certain areas e.g. the inner side of your teeth, the bacteria in plaque start to change. The plaque starts to become harder to remove and the type of bacteria changes into anaerobic bacteria which is more dangerous to our teeth and gums.  \n\nSo the aim of brushing is to regularly remove this soft plaque from all areas in the mouth when it is easy to remove and before it has the chance to grow into the hazardous type of bacteria which cause “Gum Disease” and “Dental Caries”. if you aren’t brushing well and plaque is left to build up and stay on your teeth- you are putting yourself more at risk of gum disease."

                "data": "When dental plaque has not been removed for a minimum of 10-14 days, it starts to calcify becoming very hard and stuck to your teeth. This is called calculus or tartar. It is the minerals from your saliva (calcium and phosphate) which become incorporated into the plaque which allows this to happen. The calculus actually attracts more plaque to attach to it meaning more harmful bacteria!\n\nIt is most commonly found in-between and on the back of your bottom front teeth. It is usually a yellowish colours however I can take up staining becoming brown or black. (Check if this is true) Unfortunately once dental plaque reaches this stage and becomes calculus you can’t remove it with regular tooth brushing. Therefore you need to see your dentist, who will have special cleaning tools to remove this calculus for you.\n\nRemember the longer you leave calculus on your teeth the greater at risk you are of developing gum disease. So it’s better to see your dentist sooner rather than later. I also hope this highlights the idea of cleaning dental plaque before it gets to this stage.\n\nThere are two categories of calculus, that which forms above the gums which we can see in our mouths and that which forms under our gums called subgingival calculus. This subgingival calculus is attached to the roots of your teeth and requires a much deeper clean by your dentist to remove. Your dentist may need to numb the area first before cleaning as it is under your gums which can be very sore after treatment."

So you should go see your dentist to get this removed before you can change your oral hygiene grade from poor/ok to good.\n\nWhen my patients first start the challenge of improving their oral hygiene I usually get them to buy a plaque disclosing tablet. This is a purple vegetable dye which stains colourless plaque dark blue. It is perfect to use after you have finished brushing your teeth as it stains all the surfaces which have not been missed by the brush. These tablets are cheap and are good to use initially until you have the hang of it. I understand you may be thinking its only teethbrushing but you’ll be surprised how these small changes can have a major impact to your dental health over the years.  "

The only complete way of treating this disease is to improve our oral hygiene ourselves.\n\nIt is important to first get a good clean from your dentist or hygienist. This is required to remove the harden calculus and plaque which we cannot remove ourselves via regularly brushing. However the gum disease will still persist if you do not keep removing the build-up of fresh plaque so I cannot stress enough the importance of maintaining GOOD ORAL HYGIENE.\n\nOnce your dentist cleans the calculus and plaque from your mouth, it will be much easier for you to maintain and keep it this way."

                "data": "Poor Oral Hygiene – I.e. leaving dental plaque to build-up. The longer plaque is left uncleaned on your teeth, the worse it gets. After 10-14 days the type of bacteria in plaque start to changes to anaerobic bacteria which increases the risk for gum disease. This is the chief modifiable risk factor which is why most periodontal dental treatment is geared towards the regular removal of plaque. So why pay us to do this when you can do it as home for free?\n\nSmoking – smoking reduces blood flow and antibodies (your bodies fighting cells) to gingival tissue which increases susceptibility to periodontitis due to direct cell damage and poor healing after treatment. Ironically smoker’s gums actually looks healthier even though they may have advance gum disease. This is due to the effect of reduce blood flow to the inflammation of gum appears less swollen and heathier however don’t let this fool you.\n\nDiabetes – diabetes affect your body ability to respond to infection and reduces the rate of healing. The more uncontrolled your diabetes is the more likily to is to affect the health of your gums.\n\nGenetics - Unfortunately with gum disease there is an element of “host susceptibility” which essentially means you are either more or less likely to have gum diseases. This comes down to your genetics and your immune system; some people are more susceptible however this isn’t your excuse to not change the other risk factors!"

                "title": "What is Gum Recession?",
                "data": "Gum recession is when your gum line which usually sits just below the crowns (top part) of your teeth have receded exposing the roots of your teeth. This can occur for two main reasons either you are over-brushing (too hard and roughly) or due to advance gum disease aka periodontitis. It may also occur as a consequence of orthodontic treatment where your teeth have been pushed too far forward and where the bone is thin meaning there isn’t enough thickness of gum tissue. then unfortunately, they are not going to grow back unless you have some complicated periodontal (gum) surgery, and this is only necessary in particular circumstances.\n\nGum recession caused by over-brushing occurs over a long period of time. If this is the case you need to change your technique or the toughness of your brush. I only never recommend a soft or medium toughness toothbrush. \n\nThe gum recession may expose the root surfaces of teeth resulting in sensitivity in your teeth. Teeth roots do not have a strong enamel layer cover them like teeth crowns do so when exposed to the oral environment they are more likely to lead in sensitivity. However there is wide variation in sensitivity from person to person, some people may have completely exposed roots and no sensitivity where other have intense sensitivity to the smallest of exposures."

                "title": "What Causes Dental Caries?",
                "data": "Dental caries is caused by a combination of these four main factors:\n\nBacteria – the bacteria in dental plaque have the ability to digest sugars and produce acids which causes minerals such as calcium and phosphate to be lost from the surface of our teeth. This process is called demineralisation. If we regularly remove these bacteria via tooth brushing is reduces the risk of tooth decay.\n\nSugar – Sugar needs to be present in order for bacteria to feed upon it, without these sugar bacteria cannot produce the acid which causes the tooth decay.\n\nSaliva – Saliva is very important in protecting our teeth, it is our natural defences against the acid produced by these bacteria. It helps to neutralize and wash away these acids. It also contains lots of minerals needed to help rebuild some of the lost tooth tissue in a process called remineralisation. However this has its limitation and once the decay has reached a certain stage that tooth tissue will be lost forever.\n\nTime – Dental caries does not occur overnight. It is a balance and repeated cycle of remineralisation and demineralisation. Good vs bad so to speak. When the balance is tipped in favour of demineralization (bad) by frequently eating too much sugar, there is not enough time for the remineralisation (good) to occur. Therefore your tooth is breaking down faster than it is being rebuilt so you ultimately end up with a cavity in your tooth.\n\nThe main point to take away from this is that WE can change this cycle in our favor. By following our oral hygiene guide and by reducing the frequency these bacteria have access to sugar we can significantly reduce the likelihood of getting dental caries."

It is crucial not to leave dental caries unchecked as it can get worse leading to require more invasive and costly treatment to try to save the tooth. or in the worst case leading to the tooth being lost.\n\nUnfortunately you cannot replace the tooth tissue which has already been lost however you can help prevent further decay from happening. We can successful stop the active decaying process before cavitation (formation of a hole) by tipping the balance in favour of remineralisation; in the dental community we call this “Arrested Caries.”  Fluoride treatment is very helpful in remineralising tooth enamel; your dentist may apply a high fluoride varnish on your teeth or give you a prescription for higher fluoride toothpaste."

However what’s more important is our technique! For years movies and TV shows have been showing us the wrong way so please follow our brushing technique guides!\n\n2) Interdental cleaning - You should be cleaning in-between your teeth once a day preferably before bedtime to make sure that no food or plaque has been left behind. The best way is either using small interdental brushes or using Dental floss.\n\n3) Spit out and do not rinse!! At first this will seem strange however it is very important we do not rinse our mouths out after we brush our teeth!! You may wonder why? Well the fluoride in your toothpaste is fantastic for teeth; it helps strengthen them so why wash away that luxurious toothpaste only after 2 minutes?\n\n4) Diet - Your diet is very important to your teeth. In general the higher the frequency of sugary food and drinks in your diet the higher risk you are at developing dental caries. Please see our guide on how diet affects your teeth for more information.\n\n5) Checks ups - Lastly please visit your dentist for a check-up and clean at least once a year. Early detection and prevention is the key in keeping your teeth and gums healthy. Be pro-active in your healthcare."
